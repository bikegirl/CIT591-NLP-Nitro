# CIT591-NLP-Nitro
CIT 591 End of the Year Project

Our project would not be possible without the contributions of NAACL paper: [Simple PPDB contextual simplification] (http://cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/simple-ppdb.pdf).  As an extension to prior work completed by [Reno Kris](https://rekriz11.github.io/), NLP Nitro aims to implement this research paper backwards and transform any content message into a higher complexity score ("Shakespearify" any text, if you will).

Dependencies: In your python environment, you must install spaCy by going to [this website](https://spacy.io/).  Although this should work with anything higher than python 2.6 or higher, we recommend python 2.7 for running this project.

Errors we encountered: the encoding for reading in a file.  Be sure to encode with UTF-8.  If you get an error that says something to the effect of not recognizing ASCII characters, this is why.
